### What is MERN

MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, React, Node. Which as you are quite aware of at this point are all various JavaScript frameworks. 

Each framework has a key component that it covers: 

- MongoDB -> Database
  - Object-Oriented Document Store NoSQL database
- ExpressJS -> Server Side Web Framework
  - Handles all interactions between the front end and the database
  - Backend NodeJS Framework
  - Also used on the front end to serve our React application in production
- ReactJS -> Front End Framework
  - Componont based Single Page Application front-end
- NodeJS -> Backend Javascript
  - Foundation of MERN

The biggest benefit of MERN is that it uses the same language, this means that you can streamline your development time. 

Because its all the same language you don't need to look for different developers that have specialties in different parts of the application, all you need are JavaScript developers.
