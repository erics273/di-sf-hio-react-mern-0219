# Day 05: The MERN Stack
Today we will focus on the MERN stack and our final lab. Our final lab creats a portfolio site that acts as the front-end of the MERN stack application. We will leverage the recipie api built with mongo and express on day 4 to complete the lab. We will also migrate our previous lab projects into our portfolio.
